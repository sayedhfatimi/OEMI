<p style="text-align:center;"><span class="text-huge">Welcome to the Online Encyclopedia for Mathematical Identities</span></p>
<p>This Wiki is designed as an easy access encyclopedia for well known and more importantly for unknown mathematical identities.</p>
<p>Submissions and changes can be posted via the Github repository: <code>https://github.com/sayedhfatimi/OEMI</code> approved submissions will automatically sync into the wiki.</p>
<p>This is still very much a work in progress and I will hope to integrate better LaTeX searchability as well as improved tagging and categorisation for finding solutions and identities much easier and faster.</p>
